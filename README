To use this program:

	rg32hash . > RG32SUMS

(This will recursively perform a RadioGatun hash on all files and folders
in the current working directory, putting the result in a file named 
"RG32SUMS")

This is a third party implementation of the 32-bit version of the
RadioGatun hash (RadioGatun[32]).  This is a test implementation that
I wrote in order to make sure I fully understood the specification.
